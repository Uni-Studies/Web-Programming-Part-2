Add Filtering to the Users Management listing page UsersList.jsx
I should be able to filter by
 - Username
 - FirstName
 - LastName

Filter data should be provided to the endpoint via Query parameters:

GET https://localhost:5000/api/Users?OrderBy=Id&SortAsc=true&Pager.Page=1&Pager.PageSize=10&Filter.Username=n&Filter.FirstName=n&Filter.LastName=n

Filter should be displayed above the Users grid. In the form of TextBox inputs.
I should have two buttons:
 - Filter (applies the filter)
 - Clear (clears the filter)
